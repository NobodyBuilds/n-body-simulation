# 🌌 N-Body Simulation

A gravity-based particle simulation written in **C++**.  
Simulates N-body interactions using classical **Newtonian gravity**.

Currently, the simulation is in active development.  
It uses the **Barnes–Hut algorithm** for gravity computation along with **Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH)** concepts for astrophysical behavior.

This is my **first-ever simulation project**, so the code is messy in places:
- inconsistent naming
- various performance issues
- bugs and rough edges

That said, everything will be improved over time.  
I’m still learning **C++**, so feel free to contribute, suggest improvements, or roast the code constructively ❤️

## 🔥 Features
- Real-time visualization
- Scalable (hardware dependent)
- Deterministic physics-based simulation

---

## ⚙️ Requirements
- Windows 10 / 11
- No specific GPU required (CPU-only for now)

---

## ▶️ Usage
1. Download the latest release
2. Run the executable
3. Observe and experiment with particle behavior

---

## 🚧 Status
Still in development ⚠️

- 🧠 Medium performance: ~**1500–2000 particles**  
  (may vary depending on CPU)
- Currently uses **CPU only** for computation and physics
- GPU acceleration (**CUDA**) is planned for future versions
- Expect bugs, crashes, and performance limitations
- Code structure and variable naming are messy (for now)

---

## 🛠️ Currently Working On
- Improving performance
- Cleaning and refactoring code
- Transitioning computation to **CUDA**

---

## 📝 Notes
This repository currently hosts a **CPU-based pre-release build**.  
Source code and GPU-based implementations will be added as development progresses.
